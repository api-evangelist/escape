# Escape (escape)
Escape was founded in 2020 after one of our co-founders experienced a cyberattack and saw firsthand how vulnerable exposed APIs can be. Driven by a belief in the power of AI to transform cybersecurity, we built a platform that emulates hacker behavior to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Today, Escape goes beyond traditional protectionhelping you document all your APIs, detect complex business logic flaws across modern applications like APIs, SPAs, and Microservices, and seamlessly integrate security into your CI/CD pipeline. You can trust Escape to keep your applications secure.
