  Escape was founded in 2020 after one of our co-founders experienced a
  cyberattack and saw firsthand how vulnerable exposed APIs can be. Driven by a
  belief in the power of AI to transform cybersecurity, we built a platform that
  emulates hacker behavior to identify vulnerabilities before they can be
  exploited. Today, Escape goes beyond traditional protectionhelping you
  document all your APIs, detect complex business logic flaws across modern
  applications like APIs, SPAs, and Microservices, and seamlessly integrate
  security into your CI/CD pipeline. You can trust Escape to keep your
  applications secure.
