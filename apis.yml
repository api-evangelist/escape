  Escape was founded in 2020 after one of our co-founders experienced a
  cyberattack and saw firsthand how vulnerable exposed APIs can be. Driven by a
  belief in the power of AI to transform cybersecurity, we built a platform that
  emulates hacker behavior to identify vulnerabilities before they can be
  exploited. Today, Escape goes beyond traditional protectionhelping you
  document all your APIs, detect complex business logic flaws across modern
  applications like APIs, SPAs, and Microservices, and seamlessly integrate
  security into your CI/CD pipeline. You can trust Escape to keep your
  applications secure.
